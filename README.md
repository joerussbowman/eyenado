=======

Eyenado is a survelliance camera management software written using Python Tornado

It's built using a simple design. Currently it's being tested against
an Agasio brand camera that uses the Foscam api. It should be able
to handle any camera which accepts a url as a parameter.

Current requirements are PIL and numpy, both installable via pip.
